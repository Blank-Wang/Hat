Hat is an open source deep learning framework. We would like to thank Keras, from which we folked a lot of codes. Keras is excellent, with clear code and structure. Compared with Keras, Hat is a deep learning framework provides more functions for (but not limited to) audio processing. Hat allows users to build their neural network in a more flexible way, with a lot of example codes for audio processing. Please click <a href="/installation.html">Installation</a>.
